    <p>Click on the rght side of the leaf to go to my Photo Gallery. I have created this Photo Gallery to depict how grief feels like to me.</p>
    <p>However if you're in a lighter mood, click on the left side of the leaf to go through some movies that got me through life.</p>

    <p>Many people are plagued by grief and grief has become such a stigma that eventually sometimes people are just left all alone. </p>
    <p>The photo gallery, although morbid, is a depiction of how sometimes just simply navigating through it all feels like.</p>
    <p>And what else is there to do when you want to get distracted and pass time but watch some omfort movies and shows</p>
    <p>So this page is a very transparent outlet for some of the things that have defined some people's life.</p>
