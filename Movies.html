        <h1>Before we go</h1>
        <p>This movie is one of the simplest and most beautiful movies that I have ever seen. </p>
        <p>Two conflicted individuals, both going through some stuff in their lives coincidentally cross paths and spend the night just walking and talking together. The movie focuses on the simplicity of just that moment where you just feel an intense connection with someone instantly</p>

                <h1>A lot like Love</h1>
                <p>This would be one of my favourite movies.As the years pass and they live their separate lives, fate brings them together several times, and they become close friends. Any time one of them wants more out of the relationship, the other seems content with just being friends.
                    But no matter what came in between them, they manage to end up together. While it does make me bittersweet, it's a movie that was significantly enjoyed watching and was one of the rare good days we had during his cancer treatment.

      <h1>Arrow</h1>
      <p>After a violent shipwreck, billionaire playboy Oliver Queen was missing and presumed dead for 5 years before being discovered alive on a remote island in the North China Sea. When he returns home to Starling City, his devoted mother, Moira, much-beloved sister, Thea, and best friend, Tommy welcome him home, but they sense Oliver has been changed by his ordeal on the island. While Oliver hides the truth about the man he has become, he desperately wants to make amends for the actions he took as the boy he was.
        As Oliver reconnects with those closest to him, he secretly creates the persona of the Arrow, a vigilante archer, to right the wrongs of his family, fight the ills of society and restore Starling City to its former glory. By day, Oliver plays the role of a wealthy, carefree and careless philanderer he used to be, flanked by his devoted chauffeur and bodyguard, John Diggle, while carefully concealing the secret identity he turns to under the cover of darkness.

          <h1>No Strings Attached</h1>
            <p>Occasionally in the 15 years since summer camp, Adam and Emma cross paths. When he discovers that an ex-girlfriend is living with his dad, he gets drunk, calls every woman in his cell phone contact list, and ends up passed out naked in her living room. By this time, she's a medical resident in L.A. and he's a gopher on a "Glee"-like TV series, hoping to be a writer. She guards her emotions (calling her father's funeral "a thing"), so after a quick shag in the moments she has before leaving for the hospital, she asks if he wants a no-strings-attached, sex-only relationship, without romance or complications. A prescription for fun or for disaster?
