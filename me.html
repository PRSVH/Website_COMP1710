    <h1 id="abtme">About me</h1>
    <p>There isn't much to say about me. I am quite a boring person. But I do like movies and music and I guess the only way to introduce myself would be through my favourite songs.
      This is what this website is about. </p>
    <p>However, given that I am creating this website with my person in mind, maybe I could attach a comic strip(Storyboard) to share my story. So here's my sad story.</p>

    <h1 id="passion">My passion</h1>
    <img src="Images\cry.jpg"  width="200" height="200" alt="img1">
    <p>Honestly I don't really enjoy anything but listening to music and looking at memes. I however do enjoy sports, namely swimming, martial arts and track. However all I do now is just try to survive. </p>
